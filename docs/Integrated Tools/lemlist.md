## Intro

[lemlist](https://www.lemlist.com/) describes itself as "the prospecting tool to automate multichannel outreach and actually get replies." It blends a large B2B database and waterfall enrichment with AI‑driven personalization, then runs email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and call sequences from one place, backed by lemwarm deliverability to keep messages out of spam.


## Setup

### API key retreival
Once you have an account set up with lemlist, you can find your API key by navigating from the Dashboard:
- Click on your username in the bottom left corner, then select 'Settings'
- Scroll down to 'Integrations on the left hand tab
- Click on 'Generate on the upper right', enter a name for your API key, ('launchyfi_integration' is recomended) and generate your key.
- Copy the key. You are free to save it somewhere else but if you only use it for Launchyfi then copying it here should be enough
- in the Launchyfi website, navigate to the integrations tab
- add an integration
- select lemlist from the services list, paste the API key in the box, and save!
