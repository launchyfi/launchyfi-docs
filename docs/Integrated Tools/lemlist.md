## Setup

### API key retreival
Once you have an account set up with lemlist, you can find your API key by navigating from the Dashboard:
- Click on your username in the bottom left corner, then select 'Settings'
- Scroll down to 'Integrations on the left hand tab
- Click on 'Generate on the upper right' and enter a name for your API key; ('launchyfi_integration' is reccomended) and generate your key.
- Copy the key. You are free to save it somewhere else but if you only use it for Launchyfi then copying it here should be enough
- in the Launchyfi website, navigate to the integrations tab
- add an integration
- select lemlist from the services list, paste the API key in the box, and save!
