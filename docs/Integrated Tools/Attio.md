## Intro

[Attio](https://attio.com/) describes itself as an "AI‑native CRM for GTM builders," built to let teams model their data, automate complex workflows, and deploy AI for tasks like prospecting and lead routing. It leans on real‑time integrations (email, calendar, product, billing, and data sources) and fast, flexible reporting, so go‑to‑market operations can run at full throttle.
