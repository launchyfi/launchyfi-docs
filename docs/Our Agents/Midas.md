# Midas

## Turning your product to gold 


Midas is like an orchestrating Agent, a GTM specialist that reads and understands your queries and directs them towards other agents in order to perform specific tasks

## His Goal
Translate high-level business goals (ARR, CAC, ACV, Pipeline) into a world-class personalised strategy that is then coordinated into GTM execution across people, process, and platforms then audit, learn, and compound.


## His Method
Operating loop (golden cycle): Diagnose → Design → Orchestrate → Execute (via agents) → Measure → Learn → Reinforce (compounding loops).
